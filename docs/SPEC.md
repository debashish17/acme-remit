# Acme Remit for Alexa+ — Build Spec & Hackathon Plan

Oct 1, 2026 · @Debashish · updated Oct 4, 2026 after the hackathon FAQ

## Locked decisions

Acme Remit is one remittance provider's own Alexa+ add-on: a self-hosted MCP server (spec 2025-11-25, Streamable HTTP) over a simulated ledger, entered in the Alexa+ track plus the AWS Builder and Open Source mini challenges. Its own web simulator, which stands in for Alexa+, is the demo, and the whole experience runs locally with nothing but Node.

| Decision | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framing | Single provider ("Acme Remit", name TBD), UAE–India corridor, AED to INR | Matches how every real Alexa+ add-on works; one board rate, one backend, no scraping |
| Rates | Live mid-market from Frankfurter (ECB), cached 15 min; ECB publishes no AED, so AED/INR is USD/INR divided by the CBUAE peg of 3.6725 AED per USD, plus a simulated Acme FX margin; seeded fallback table. Customer sees "our rate" plus the guaranteed receive amount, Wise-style mid shown only in `compare_options`. Every other currency ECB publishes, plus the dollar-pegged Gulf currencies (AED, SAR, QAR, OMR, BHD), can be quoted by `get_rate` as a mid-market rate for information; sending stays AED to INR. | Realistic pricing model, one dependency, demo never breaks |
| Payout methods | Bank deposit via IMPS (instant), UPI ID (instant), cash pickup (MTSS caps). No economy/express tiers | What UAE exchange houses actually offer; cash pickup brings a real regulatory cap into the demo |
| Competitor data | None live. `compare_options` shows the mid rate, Acme's rate, and a labelled illustrative typical-bank rate derived from the same mid | Honest, defensible, still reads well aloud |
| Funding | Saved debit card, charged at confirm; funds received instantly in the mock | Voice cannot take card details; matches per-transfer funding norms |
| Money movement | Simulated ledger only; every write labelled "no real funds move" | Expected for the event; the tool contract is production-shaped |
| User and KYC tier | One demo user (Priya, Dubai), tier "Verified" (Emirates ID done, no income proof), Bearer token auth | Tier explains the limits; account linking (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE) documented as the production path |
| Recipients | Resolved by nickname server-side via `resolve_beneficiary`; adding or editing recipients is out of scope | Adding payees by voice is a fraud surface; say so on purpose |
| Compliance | Purpose of remittance captured (family maintenance default); screening hold modelled as ON\_HOLD with an RFI the customer can act on; reason for a hit is never disclosed (tipping-off) | Shows real AML behaviour without inventing internals |
| State changes | Only `confirm_transfer` and `cancel_transfer` move money, both behind the same read-back-and-token gate; `set_rate_alert` writes alert state | The asymmetry is the headline safety claim |
| Step-up | Before money moves, `confirm_transfer` texts a 6-digit one-time code to the registered phone (simulated SMS) and charges the card only on a second call carrying it; 3 wrong tries void the confirmation. Cancels need no code (the refund goes to the same card) | Mirrors 3-D Secure on card payments; the code never appears in a tool result, so the model cannot approve a payment on its own |
| Demo path and judging | Our own web simulator is the demo. Amazon's Alexa+ CLI, MCP Toolkit and web simulator are not available to participants, hosting is not required, and judges run the repo locally without AWS credentials. So the simulator needs nothing but Node: scripted mode drives the real tools from the demo script with no language model; Amazon Bedrock (default) or any OpenAI-compatible model turns on free conversation | From the hackathon FAQ (Oct 4): a judge must see the whole flow on a clean clone with no account |
| Cross-session context | `get_pending` returns what is waiting since the last conversation (open quotes, transfers under review with their RFI, rate alerts that fired, the last transfer per recipient). The assistant calls it at the start of each conversation and resolves "send the usual to Mum" from it | Conversations aren't stored; the ledger is the memory, so context carries across sessions without keeping transcripts |
| Stack | TypeScript, Express, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, SQLite (better-sqlite3); in the simulator Amazon Bedrock (Nova 2 Lite) or any OpenAI-compatible model, or scripted mode without one; Amazon Polly for the voice when AWS credentials exist; optional hosting on AWS App Runner us-east-1 | Lowest ops for a solo build; runs with no account; Bedrock and Polly satisfy AWS Builder |

Open item: the product name. Placeholder `acme-remit` in code until chosen.

## Architecture

The MCP layer is a thin adapter; every rule about money lives in the core module, which has no idea MCP exists. That split is what lets the README say "swap `core/ledger` for the production API" and mean it.

&#91;embedded content: architecture · 5 layers, one external call\]

Requests flow top to bottom; the only outbound network call is the cached rate fetch, so every tool answers from local data well inside the 500 ms budget Alexa+ requires.

**A transfer, end to end ("Send 2,000 dirhams to Mum")**

1. Model calls `resolve_beneficiary("Mum")` → one match, `ben_01`, bank deposit, name verified.
2. Model calls `quote_transfer(2000, "AED", "ben_01", "bank_deposit", "family_maintenance")` → core reads the cached mid rate, applies the corridor FX margin, adds the flat fee, checks tier limits and velocity, writes a quote row (rate and fee locked 30 min), returns the guaranteed receive amount, ETA and `quote_id`.
3. Model reads the quote back. User: "Confirm."
4. Model calls `prepare_transfer(quote_id)` → core issues a single-use `confirmation_token` (5-min expiry) and returns the exact read-back sentence. Model says it again; this is the consent step.
5. User: "Yes." Model calls `confirm_transfer(token)` → the server texts a 6-digit code to the customer's phone and refuses `STEP_UP_REQUIRED`; nothing has moved. The user reads the code out, and the model calls `confirm_transfer(token, otp)` → core validates the token and the code, re-checks limits, charges the saved card (mock, instant), writes the transfer as `FUNDS_RECEIVED` then `SCREENING`, returns `transfer_ref`.
6. A background ticker moves it to `SENT_TO_PARTNER` after 15 s and `PAID_OUT` with a generated UTR after 30 s, so `track_transfer` changes during the video. One seeded past transfer sits in `RETURNED` and one in `ON_HOLD` with an RFI, so the model can explain those states too.

**Real vs simulated**

| Component | Real | Simulated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP server, Streamable HTTP, spec 2025-11-25 | yes |  |
| Bearer auth, token lifecycle, limit enforcement | yes |  |
| The assistant: Amazon Bedrock or any OpenAI-compatible model | yes | scripted mode when none is configured (real tools, fixed script) |
| AWS App Runner deployment (optional) | yes |  |
| Mid-market exchange rates | yes, Frankfurter |  |
| Acme FX margin, fees, payout methods, KYC tier limits |  | yes |
| Card funding, ledger, screening, payout partner, UTRs |  | yes |
| SMS delivery of the step-up code (shown on a simulated phone) |  | yes |

## Tool contract

Twelve tools, one domain, two money-moving tools behind one gate. The `description` strings below are the product copy the model reads to pick a tool: ship them verbatim and tune only after watching the simulator mis-pick.

| # | Tool | Description (what the model reads) | Writes state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `get_rate` | Get today's exchange rate with the 7-day trend. For AED to INR it is Acme's rate for sending money to India; for any other pair of supported currencies it is the mid-market rate, for information only, because Acme sends money only from AED to INR. Use when the user asks about the rate, the rupee or another currency, or whether now is a good time to send. | no |
| 2 | `compare_options` | Compare what the recipient would receive for a send amount across Acme's payout methods (bank deposit, UPI, cash pickup), including fee and arrival time, and show Acme's rate against the mid-market rate and a typical bank rate. Use when the user asks which option is best or how much will be received. | no |
| 3 | `list_beneficiaries` | List the user's saved recipients: nickname, relationship, bank or UPI, payout method, and when they last received money. Use when the user asks who they can send to. | no |
| 4 | `resolve_beneficiary` | Find one saved recipient from a name or nickname such as "Mum", "my brother" or "Sunita". Call this before quoting whenever the user names a person. Returns one match, or candidates to ask the user to choose from. Never invents a recipient; new recipients are added in the Acme app. | no |
| 5 | `quote_transfer` | Price a transfer: fee, locked rate, guaranteed receive amount in rupees, arrival time, and any limit warnings or document requirements for the purpose. Does not move money. Returns a quote\_id with rate and fee held for 30 minutes. | quote row |
| 6 | `prepare_transfer` | Turn a quote into a confirmation request. Returns the exact sentence to read back to the user and a single-use confirmation\_token valid for 5 minutes. Does not move money. Call confirm\_transfer only after the user explicitly agrees to the read-back. | token row |
| 7 | `confirm_transfer` | Execute a prepared transfer in two calls, after the user agrees to the read-back. Called with the confirmation\_token alone, it texts a 6-digit one-time code to the user's registered phone and returns STEP\_UP\_REQUIRED; nothing is sent yet. Ask the user to read the code out, then call again with the same confirmation\_token and otp: that charges the saved debit card and submits the transfer. The code is never in a tool result, so never guess it. Fails if the token is unknown, expired or used, if the code is wrong or expired, or if limits changed since the quote. | **transfer, card charge** |
| 8 | `track_transfer` | Get the status of a transfer by reference or the most recent one: current stage, timeline, UTR once paid out, whether it can still be cancelled, and any action the user must take if it is under review. Use when the user asks where their money is or whether it was credited. | no |
| 9 | `cancel_transfer` | Cancel a transfer that has not yet been sent to the payout partner. Without a cancel\_token it returns a preview (refund amount, timing) and a single-use cancel\_token valid for 5 minutes; with the token it cancels and refunds send amount and fee to the card. Call with the token only after the user explicitly agrees to the preview. Fails once the transfer has been sent; recalls need the recipient's consent and are handled by support. | **transfer, refund** |
| 10 | `get_transfer_history` | List past transfers for the last N months or to one recipient, including cancelled, returned or refunded ones, with totals and how much of each limit has been used this month. | no |
| 11 | `check_limits` | Show the user's KYC tier, remaining per-transaction, daily and monthly limits, cash-pickup caps, the reset date, and explain any refusal code in plain words with how to resolve it. | no |
| 12 | `set_rate_alert` | Ask to be told when the AED to INR rate reaches a target. Use when the user says "tell me when" or "alert me if". | alert row |
| 13 | `get_help` | Answer general questions about sending money with Acme from the UAE to India, from Acme's reviewed help content: documents, how sending works, recipients, payout methods, fees and rates, limits and tiers, tracking and receipts, cancellations and refunds, NRE and NRO accounts, the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), tax on money received in India, and staying safe. Use it instead of general knowledge for any rule, document or tax question; for the user's own numbers use check_limits or track_transfer. | no |
| 14 | `get_pending` | Get what is waiting on the user since their last conversation: open quotes, transfers under review and what the user must do, rate alerts that fired recently, and the last transfer to each recipient. Call it once at the start of a conversation to mention anything that needs attention, and use last_by_recipient to resolve requests like "send the usual to Mum". | no |

Every refusal is structured (`code`, numbers, `resolution`) so the model can explain it well. No tool ever returns a bare string error.

## Core module interface

Six small services behind plain TypeScript interfaces; the MCP handlers only parse input, call one of these, and shape the output. Nothing in `core/` imports the MCP SDK, so every rule is unit-testable with no transport.

## Data model and seed data

One SQLite file, ten tables after migrations, reset to the seed on every `npm run seed` so each demo take starts identical.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users        (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, country TEXT, kyc_tier TEXT, card_last4 TEXT);

The block above is migration 1 (`src/db/schema.sql`). Later changes are numbered files in `src/db/migrations/`, tracked in `PRAGMA user_version`:

```sql
-- 0002_cancel_token_target.sql
-- Cancel tokens (cx_) record the transfer they cancel; confirmation tokens (ct_) keep using quote_id.
-- The token kind is its prefix. session_id holds the caller binding key (stateless transport, no MCP session id).

CREATE INDEX transfer_events_ref ON transfer_events (ref, at);

-- 0003_step_up.sql
-- One-time codes before money moves (salted SHA-256, bound to the ct_ token hash and caller),
-- and the simulated phone that receives them.

The two Rahuls exist on purpose: "send money to Rahul" triggers the disambiguation turn. The ON\_HOLD transfer to the NRE account gives the model a real RFI to explain, and the RETURNED one lets it explain a bounce, the FX loss on refund, and the kept fee.

## Transfer lifecycle and glossary

Five stages on the main path and three exits; the demo advances the main path on a timer, the user can reach Cancelled by voice before the transfer is sent, and the other two exits exist in seed data so the model can explain them.

&#91;embedded content: transfer lifecycle · 5 stages, 3 exits\]

Most transfers reach paid out in minutes; the slow tail comes from screening holds and funding delays, not the payout rail. On a hold the customer sees "Under review" and, only if something is needed from them, an RFI such as an updated Emirates ID or salary proof. The reason for a screening hit is never disclosed.

**Glossary used in tool outputs and the simulator**

| Term | Meaning | Where it appears |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corridor | A send country and receive country pair, here UAE–India (AE-IN) | `get_rate` |
| Send amount / receive amount | What the sender pays in AED / what the recipient gets in INR | every pricing tool |
| FX margin | The difference between the mid-market rate and the customer rate; the provider's main revenue | `get_rate`, `compare_options` |
| Rate lock / guaranteed rate | Rate and fee held for a window so the receive amount is fixed | `quote_transfer` |
| Payout method | How the recipient gets the money: bank deposit (IMPS), UPI, cash pickup | `compare_options`, `quote_transfer` |
| Payout partner | The Indian bank or MTSS agent that credits the recipient | lifecycle, `track_transfer` |
| UTR | Unique Transaction Reference from the Indian banking system; what the recipient's bank asks for | `track_transfer` |
| FIRA | Foreign Inward Remittance Advice, the receipt used for tax and bank purposes in India | `confirm_transfer` receipt line |
| Purpose of remittance | Declared reason, mapped to CBUAE and RBI purpose codes behind the scenes | `quote_transfer` |
| Source of funds | Evidence of where large send amounts came from, requested above a threshold | `check_limits`, RFI |
| RFI | Request for information during a compliance hold | `track_transfer` |
| Returned / bounced | Payout failed at the recipient bank; money refunded to the sender, often with FX loss and fee kept | `track_transfer`, history |
| Recall | Asking for money back after it has landed; needs recipient consent, out of scope | README only |
| MTSS | India's Money Transfer Service Scheme governing cash pickup caps | `compare_options` caps |
| KYC tier | Verification level that sets the user's limits | `check_limits` |

Consumer-facing words win in anything the model speaks: recipient not beneficiary, sender not remitter, "under review" not "on hold".

## Quote and token lifecycle, and the tests to write

A transfer needs four calls in order (quote, prepare, confirm, confirm with the code), and each step can only be used once; the tests below are the evidence judges look for in the repo.

**Rules**

1. `quote_transfer` writes a quote with status `open`, rate and fee locked for 30 min, and the guaranteed receive amount. A quote is priced once; `confirm` never re-fetches the rate.
Tokens are bound to the authenticated caller (the principal from the Bearer check; the OAuth subject and client in production), never to an MCP session: the transport is stateless and has no session id. The `session_id` columns hold that caller key.

2. `prepare_transfer` requires an `open`, unexpired quote. It moves the quote to `prepared`, issues one random 32-byte token (base64url) bound to the quote and the authenticated caller (stateless transport, so no MCP session id), expiry now + 5 min. Calling prepare again on the same quote invalidates the previous token.
3. `confirm_transfer` requires a token that exists, is unused, unexpired, and was issued to the same authenticated caller. It re-runs the limit check, then in one SQLite transaction: marks the token used, marks the quote `consumed`, records the mock card charge, inserts the transfer as `FUNDS_RECEIVED` and immediately `SCREENING`, and writes both timeline events.
3a. Step-up. `confirm_transfer` with a valid token and no `otp` changes nothing in the ledger: it texts a 6-digit code to the user's registered phone, naming the amount and recipient, and refuses `STEP_UP_REQUIRED` with `sent_to`, `expires_at` and `attempts_left`. The code is stored as a salted SHA-256 hash bound to the token's hash and the caller, lasts 5 minutes and never outlives the token, and is never logged or returned by any tool. Only a second call with the same token and the right `otp` runs rule 3. A wrong code refuses `OTP_INVALID` with `attempts_left`; the third voids the token (`OTP_LOCKED`); an expired code refuses `OTP_EXPIRED`; at most 3 codes are sent per token. The simulator masks the code in the protocol panel to its first two digits.
4. The ticker advances `SCREENING` → `SENT_TO_PARTNER` → `PAID_OUT` and generates a UTR on payout. `ON_HOLD`, `RETURNED` and `CANCELLED` are set as follows: CANCELLED only by cancel\_transfer, and only while the transfer is in CREATED, FUNDS\_RECEIVED, SCREENING or ON\_HOLD, refunding the amount charged (the send amount, which includes the fee) to the card and releasing the amount from the monthly and daily counters; ON\_HOLD and RETURNED only by seed data or a dev control. No tool recalls.
5. Any rejected confirm is logged with the reason and the token prefix, never the full token.
6. A transfer in `ON_HOLD` reports `customer_label: "Under review"` and the RFI if one exists; it never reports a screening reason.

Run `npm test` in CI (GitHub Actions on every push) so the green badge is in the README on submission day.

## Simulated Alexa+ client

The simulator stands in for Alexa+ and is the official demo path: Amazon's Alexa+ CLI, MCP Toolkit and web simulator are not available to hackathon participants (and Alexa+ isn't available in India). Its server-side relay talks to the MCP server over the same HTTP endpoint Alexa+ would, so nothing in the MCP server is simulator-specific; the browser never holds the Bearer secret.

**Modes.** `SIM_MODE=scripted|bedrock`, decided at startup and logged. Unset, it is `bedrock` (the live model through `LLM_PROVIDER`) when a model is usable (AWS credentials resolve, or `LLM_API_KEY` is set) and `scripted` otherwise. Scripted mode follows the demo beats (plus the suggestion chips, the receipt's Cancel button, a code read as digits or words, and "the usual") and drives the real tools through the same relay, so every step is still a genuine `POST /mcp` round trip; free text outside the script gets a notice that no model is configured. `LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock|openai_compatible` (with `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`) picks the live model; an adapter translates Converse to `/chat/completions`, so the loop, the consent guard and the relay are the same either way.

**How it works**

1. On load, the page calls `GET /sim/tools`. The relay, which holds the Bearer secret, calls the server's own `POST /mcp` with `initialize` then `tools/list` and returns the 14 tool schemas, the negotiated `protocolVersion` and the raw JSON-RPC exchange for the protocol panel.
2. The user speaks (Web Speech API, `webkitSpeechRecognition`) or types. The transcript is appended to a message history.
3. The page sends the new turn to `POST /sim/chat`. The relay keeps the conversation server-side (tool calls included, in memory, 30-minute expiry) and forwards it with the tool schemas to the live model: Amazon Bedrock (Nova 2 Lite, or Claude on Bedrock) via the Converse API with tool use, or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. In scripted mode, the scripted engine answers instead, with no model. Keeping the model behind the server avoids shipping keys to the browser; Bedrock is the documented AWS Builder integration.
4. When the model returns a tool call, the relay executes it against its own `/mcp` endpoint (a real JSON-RPC round trip, not an in-process shortcut), feeds the result back, and loops until the model returns text. It returns the reply together with each JSON-RPC request and response and its latency in ms; tokens are shown by prefix only.
5. The reply is rendered as a chat bubble and spoken. With AWS credentials it uses Amazon Polly (`POST /sim/speak`: neural voice Kajal, Indian English, with word timings that drive the read-back highlight), cached per line and capped per day by `SIM_DAILY_TTS_CHARS`; without them, or if Polly fails, the browser's `speechSynthesis`.

**The system prompt given to the model** is the one place you emulate Alexa+ behaviour: call `get_pending` at the start of a conversation and mention anything pending in one sentence, be brief, speak amounts in words, always read back a prepared transfer and wait for an explicit yes before calling `confirm_transfer`, then ask the user to read the texted code and never guess it, ask the user to choose when a recipient is ambiguous, resolve "the usual" from `get_pending`, say "recipient" and "receive amount" rather than "beneficiary" or "payout", never speculate about why a transfer is under review, answer rules, documents and tax only from `get_help`, and explain refusals using the `resolution` text.

**On screen**

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Conversation column | Chat bubbles with a mic button; the Alexa-style blue light bar while listening (no Amazon logos or wordmarks) |
| Protocol panel (collapsible, right) | Live JSON-RPC: each request and response, the negotiated `protocolVersion`, latency per call in ms |
| Ledger strip (top) | Balance, open quote, latest transfer status; updates live so the ticker is visible |
| Phone (text messages) | The customer's simulated phone: step-up codes arrive as an SMS toast, which the user reads out |
| Demo player | Play demo shows the demo beats one at a time (from `/sim/tools`, the same list scripted mode follows); Play all runs them in a row, each after the last reply is spoken |
| Mode banner | In scripted mode, says no language model is configured and how to add one; flashes when a line falls outside the script |
| Banner | "Simulated ledger: no real funds move. Mid-market rates are live; Acme pricing is simulated." always visible |
| Dev controls (hidden behind `?dev=1`) | Fire alert, advance ticker, release the held transfer, reset seed: used only while recording |

Serve the simulator as static files from the same Express app at `/`, so `pnpm dev` (or one App Runner service, if hosted) serves both.

**Access.** Locally and on a public URL alike, `/sim/*` requires `SIM_ACCESS_CODE` (a local `.env` sets it; for a hosted copy it goes to judges in the Devpost text) and is rate-limited per IP, with caps on tool rounds and tokens per turn and a daily ceiling on Bedrock calls. `/dev/*` is off unless `DEV_CONTROLS_CODE` is set. The page sends the code in a header. Because the ledger is SQLite on the instance, App Runner runs exactly one instance (min 1, max 1), and every deploy starts from the seed.

## MCP Apps view

MCP Apps (the official MCP extension `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`, stable spec 2026-01-26) lets a tool name an interactive HTML view that the host renders in a sandboxed iframe next to the conversation. It is one of the Alexa+ track's linked resources, with Agent Skills. Acme Remit ships one view, `ui://acme-remit/transfer`: a screen for the transfer the assistant is talking through, with one job the voice channel does badly, which is taking the step-up code.

**Resource.** `ui://acme-remit/transfer`, mimeType `text/html;profile=mcp-app`, one self-contained HTML document (script and styles inline) built from `src/ui/transfer/` with the official SDK's `App` class (`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` 1.x). `_meta.ui`: an empty `csp` (the view makes no network requests; it talks only to its host over `postMessage`), no extra permissions, `prefersBorder: true`. It follows the host's theme and style variables when the host sends them.

**Linked tools.** `quote_transfer`, `prepare_transfer`, `confirm_transfer` and `track_transfer` carry `_meta.ui.resourceUri: "ui://acme-remit/transfer"`, with the default visibility (model and app). Their descriptions, input schemas and results do not change, and a host without MCP Apps ignores `_meta`, so every other client sees the same 14 tools. The transport is stateless, so `tools/list` never sees the client's capabilities; the server always declares the link.

| Tool result the view receives | The view shows | What the view can do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quote_transfer` | Quote: send amount, fee, our rate, the guaranteed receive amount, the rate-lock countdown, warnings | Nothing; quoting is the assistant's job |
| `prepare_transfer` | The read-back: recipient, bank, purpose, card charged, receive amount, and the token's 5-minute countdown | **Confirm** and **Not now** send "Yes." or "No." into the conversation (`ui/message`), so consent stays with the assistant and the consent guard |
| `confirm_transfer` refused `STEP_UP_REQUIRED` | Code entry: six digit boxes, the phone it went to, tries left, the code's countdown | Sends the code with `tools/call` `confirm_transfer {confirmation_token, otp}` straight through the host. **The code never passes through the model.** `OTP_INVALID` keeps the boxes open with the tries left |
| `confirm_transfer` success, or `track_transfer` | Live receipt: reference, receive amount, ETA and the status steps | Polls `track_transfer` through the host every few seconds until a final status (10 minutes at most). Under review shows `customer_label` "Under review" and the RFI, never a reason |
| Any refusal | The refusal's `resolution` and its numbers | Nothing |

After a confirm from the view, the view tells the assistant with `ui/update-model-context` (reference and status, never the code), so the next turn knows the money has gone.

**Security.** The view receives the tool result as the model does, so it holds the confirmation token; without the code from the phone the token cannot move money. The rules a host must keep, and the simulator does:

* Render the view in an iframe sandboxed with `allow-scripts` only (an opaque origin), under a CSP built from `_meta.ui.csp`; with ours empty, the view can make no requests.
* Let the view call only tools whose visibility includes "app". The simulator is stricter: only tools linked to the same view.
* Never give the view the Bearer secret. In the simulator, view calls go through the relay like the model's, are rate-limited, and appear in the protocol panel marked "app view", with the code masked.

**The simulator as a host.** The simulator page is an MCP Apps host, so the view runs with nothing but Node:

1. It reads each tool's `_meta.ui.resourceUri` from `tools/list`, and its relay announces the extension in `initialize` (`capabilities.extensions["io.modelcontextprotocol/ui"]`).
2. When a linked tool runs, the page asks `POST /sim/app-view`. The relay fetches the view with `resources/read` (a real MCP call, shown in the protocol panel) and the server returns a single-use frame URL (60 seconds) that serves that HTML under the CSP built from the resource's `_meta.ui`.
3. The page connects to the view with the SDK's `AppBridge` over `postMessage` and sends it `tool-input` and `tool-result` for each linked call. One view follows one transfer and updates in place; a new transfer gets a new view.
4. View tool calls go to `POST /sim/app-tool` and context updates to `POST /sim/app-context`. The live model sees the context in its next turn; scripted mode clears the confirmation it was waiting on.
5. When the view can't load, the page falls back to its own cards.

Any other MCP Apps host renders the same view from the same server, for example MCPJam or VS Code; the README shows how.

**Tests.**

* `resources/list` and `resources/read` return the view with mimeType `text/html;profile=mcp-app`, and the HTML loads nothing from outside.
* `tools/list` links exactly the four tools; descriptions and schemas are unchanged.
* `/sim/app-tool` refuses tools not linked to the view and takes a code entered in the view through to a confirmed transfer, with the code masked in the panel.
* `/sim/app-context` reaches the next turn.
* The frame URL works once, expires, and carries the view's CSP.

## Hackathon step-by-step plan

Submit by Oct 22, 2026; the Devpost deadline is Oct 23, 2026 at 12:00 PDT (00:30 IST on Oct 24). Judging runs Nov 9–20, 2026 (12:00 PT to 12:00 PT), and the project must stay available to judges, free and unrestricted, until it ends; winners are announced on or around Dec 3, 2026. Per the FAQ, judges clone the repo and run it locally, without AWS credentials, so "available" means a public repo whose `README` run steps work on a clean clone; hosting is optional.

&#91;embedded content: build plan · 6 phases, submit Oct 22\]

Each phase ends with a checkable milestone; if a phase slips, cut from phase 4 first, never from phase 5.

**Phase 0 · Oct 1–2 · Setup, zero code**

- [ ] Register on Devpost and join the hackathon; create an Amazon developer account
- [ ] Request the $150 AWS credits via the hackathon form; enable Bedrock model access in us-east-1
- [ ] Create the GitHub repo (public, MIT license), add `FRICTION_LOG.md` and `FEEDBACK.md`, log from the first command
- [ ] Install Node 22, pnpm, Alexa AI CLI; run `alexa-ai configure` and note what happens from India

* Milestone: repo exists, first friction entry written
* Status: done, except the Alexa AI CLI, which participants can't get (FAQ)

**Phase 1 · Oct 3–6 · Protocol skeleton**

- [ ] Express app, `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` stateless mode on `POST /mcp`, Bearer middleware, `GET /health`
- [ ] One trivial tool (`get_rate` returning a constant); verify with MCP Inspector: initialize → tools/list → tools/call
- [ ] SQLite schema + migrate + seed scripts; Vitest + GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] `protocol.test.ts` green

* Milestone: `curl` initialize negotiates `2025-11-25`; CI badge green
* Status: done (PR #1)

**Phase 2 · Oct 7–11 · Core and 11 tools**

- [ ] `rates.ts` with Frankfurter fetch, cache, fallback; `beneficiaries.ts` resolve
- [ ] `limits.ts`, `quotes.ts` (compare + create), `confirm.ts` gate, `ledger.ts` with ticker, `alerts.ts`
- [ ] Register all 11 tools with JSON schemas and the descriptions from the contract
- [ ] All six service test files green

* Milestone: full send flow works through MCP Inspector with the refusal path visible
* Status: done (PR #2)

**Phase 3 · Oct 12–15 · Deploy and simulator**

- [ ] Dockerfile; deploy to App Runner us-east-1; measure p95 latency per tool from a US region (<500 ms)
- [ ] Simulator page: tools/list on load, mic + TTS, chat loop via `/sim/chat` → Bedrock Converse tool use
- [ ] Protocol panel, ledger strip, disclaimer banner, `?dev=1` controls
- [ ] Tune tool descriptions and the Bedrock system prompt until the six demo beats run clean three times in a row

* Milestone: public URL runs the whole demo script
* Status: done (PR #3), except the public deploy: the Dockerfile, CloudFormation template and OIDC deploy workflow are ready, but hosting turned out to be optional (FAQ), so the stack was not created and Phase 4's local milestone replaced this one

**Phase 4 · Oct 4–5 · Polish: runs with nothing but Node**

The planned Alexa+ CLI attempt was dropped: the FAQ says participants can't get Amazon's Alexa+ CLI, MCP Toolkit or web simulator.

- [x] Scripted mode (`SIM_MODE`): the demo runs through the real tools with no language model and no AWS account
- [x] Pluggable live model (`LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock|openai_compatible`)
- [x] Cross-session context: `get_pending` (tool 14), with the prompt opening each conversation from it
- [x] Agent Skill `skills/acme-remit/SKILL.md`; README run-locally section and threat model; `FEEDBACK.md` filled
- [x] `mcp-confirm-gate` package for the Open Source mini challenge, published to npm as 0.1.0 on Oct 3, 2026 by the owner

* Milestone: on a clean clone with a `.env` of only `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` and `SIM_ACCESS_CODE` and no AWS credentials, `pnpm install && pnpm db:seed && pnpm dev` starts, the simulator opens, and Play demo runs every beat end to end through real `POST /mcp` calls
* Status: done (PR #4)

**Phase 4b · Oct 3–8 · MCP Apps view**

- [x] `ui://acme-remit/transfer` resource and the `_meta.ui` link on the four transfer tools (see "MCP Apps view")
- [x] The view: quote, read-back with countdown, code entry, live receipt, built with the official `App` class into one HTML file
- [x] The simulator as an MCP Apps host: `resources/read` through the relay, sandboxed frame, `AppBridge`, `/sim/app-tool` and `/sim/app-context`
- [x] README: the view, and how to open it in another MCP Apps host

* Milestone: in the simulator, with nothing but Node, sending money shows `ui://acme-remit/transfer` moving from quote to read-back with countdown to code entry to live receipt; a code typed in the view reaches the server through the host's `tools/call`, never through the model; `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` are green
* Status: done. Checked in CI and in a headless browser (DOM only): read-back, Confirm, code entry with a wrong code then the right one, the live receipt reaching Paid out, and the assistant told

**Phase 5 · Oct 19–21 · Video and write-ups**

- [ ] Record the 2:45 video (script in the submission checklist); upload to YouTube, public, English
- [ ] README: what it does, architecture, real-vs-simulated table, run steps that need no AWS account, test badge, threat model
- [ ] `FEEDBACK.md` per tool used (MCP SDK, Bedrock, App Runner and CloudFormation, AWS CLI, Frankfurter, Devpost, Polly); feature requests with severity; friction log finalised

* Milestone: a stranger can clone, seed, run tests and play the whole demo in 10 minutes, with no AWS account

**Oct 22 · Submit**

- [ ] Fill every Devpost field; select Alexa+ track plus AWS Builder and Open Source mini challenges (a project can win at most one mini challenge)
- [ ] Repo is public, so no reviewer invites needed; double-check the license file is at the root and visible at the top (README license badge)
- [ ] Keep Oct 23 free for fixes only
- [ ] Keep the repo public and its run steps working through Nov 20, 2026 (end of judging). If a hosted copy is also offered, keep the App Runner service, its access code and the Bedrock model available that long. Check the model's end-of-life date covers it: Nova 2 Lite no sooner than Dec 2, 2026; Claude Haiku 4.5 could retire before judging, so a Claude fallback should be Sonnet 5.5

## Submission checklist

Everything Devpost asks for, mapped to where it lives in the repo, plus the video script.

| Devpost field | What we submit | Lives in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text description | What it does, how it works, the four safety properties (read-back, single-use token, server-side limits, step-up code), cross-session context, what is simulated, and that it runs locally with no AWS account | `README.md` top section |
| GitHub repo | Public, MIT license at root, run steps that need nothing but Node, test badge, Agent Skill | repo root |
| Demo video | Under 3 min, YouTube public, English, no third-party music or logos | link in README |
| Product feedback | One entry per tool: MCP TypeScript SDK, Bedrock Converse, App Runner and CloudFormation, AWS CLI, Frankfurter, Devpost, Polly; what it was used for, what worked, what did not, onboarding feel, would use again | `FEEDBACK.md` |
| Tracks | Alexa+ primary (simulator as the demo path, Agent Skill); AWS Builder (Bedrock and Polly in the simulator, App Runner infrastructure as code); Open Source (`mcp-confirm-gate` package) | form |
| Pre-existing project | Not applicable: everything built in the window; say so | form |
| Feature requests (optional) | Step-up auth before consequential tools (critical); India availability for add-on testing (important); a sandbox for participants to test Alexa+ add-ons (important); per-tool latency metrics in the developer console (nice-to-have) | `FEEDBACK.md` |
| Friction log (optional, up to +10%) | Dated entries: task, steps, expected vs actual, severity, workaround, suggestion | `FRICTION_LOG.md` |

**Video script, 2:45**

Built around the step-up moment, the strongest 15 seconds we have: the assistant texts a code, the simulated phone shows it, the user reads it back, and only then does money move.

| Time | Beat | On screen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00–0:12 | "Voice is the weakest way to approve a payment. Acme Remit is an Alexa+ add-on, a self-hosted MCP server, that makes it safe enough to send money home from the UAE to India." | The simulator, with the banner "Simulated ledger: no real funds move" in view |
| 0:12–0:22 | "Hi, anything I should know?" → "Welcome back. Your 13,000 dirham transfer to your NRE account is under review: upload an updated Emirates ID by 9 October." Context from the ledger, across sessions | Protocol panel shows `get_pending` |
| 0:22–0:30 | "What's the rupee at today?" → Acme's rate and the weekly trend | Rate card; protocol panel shows `get_rate` |
| 0:30–1:14 | **The send.** "Send 2,000 dirhams to Mum." → the read-back with recipient, bank, purpose, fee, card and guaranteed rupees, then "Shall I go ahead?" → "Yes." → "I've texted a code to your phone ending 4471." → the simulated phone shows the SMS (code, amount, recipient) → the user reads "four eight two nine one three" → confirmed, the orb gathers into a check mark, the receipt appears. Voice-over: "The code never reaches the model. Only someone holding the phone can approve, and the code works for this one payment." | Read-back card with its 5-minute countdown, then the "Check your phone" card and the phone toast; protocol panel: `prepare_transfer` (token masked), `confirm_transfer` "code texted · nothing sent yet", `confirm_transfer` with the masked code "moves money"; ledger strip updates |
| 1:14–1:24 | "Send her another three thousand." → refused: monthly limit, 1,500 left until 1 November, add salary proof to raise it | Refusal card and JSON in the panel: the server enforced it, not the model |
| 1:24–1:32 | "Send 500 to Rahul." → "Do you mean your brother Rahul Nair, or your friend Rahul Menon?" | Choose card from `resolve_beneficiary` |
| 1:32–1:48 | "Where's Mum's money?" → paid out, with the bank reference (UTR). "And the one to my NRE account?" → under review, upload an updated Emirates ID in the app, and no reason given | Receipt steps reach Paid out (dev control "Advance ticker" before the take); status card with the action needed |
| 1:48–2:04 | "Cancel the one to my NRE account." → the preview: 13,000 dirhams back to the card → "Yes." → cancelled, 14,500 of the monthly limit free again | Cancel card, then the cancelled card; `cancel_transfer` twice in the panel; ledger strip updates |
| 2:04–2:12 | "Does the LRS limit apply to me?" → no, it covers money sent out of India, from Acme's reviewed help content, not the model's memory | Help card from `get_help`, with its source and disclaimer |
| 2:12–2:20 | "Tell me when the dirham hits 26.5." → alert set, then fired | Alert card, then the toast (dev control "Fire rate alert") |
| 2:20–2:38 | How it's built: 14 MCP tools over Streamable HTTP, the step-up and token tests passing, the conversation evals, CI green, runs with nothing but Node (scripted mode), Bedrock (Nova 2 Lite) or any OpenAI-compatible model for the live assistant, Polly for the voice, and the Agent Skill | Editor, terminal and the README's threat model |
| 2:38–2:45 | "The ledger module is the only thing between this and a licensed exchange house's backend." | README real-vs-simulated table |

Record each beat separately against a local run (`pnpm dev`) and stitch them; scripted mode follows exactly these lines, and a live model makes the same tool calls. Reset the demo data before each take (`pnpm db:seed`, or the dev control). If you record a hosted copy instead, never record during a deploy (the SQLite ledger resets on every deploy). Judges aren't required to watch past three minutes, so nothing important lands after 2:40.
