 * policy values the limits and quotes enforce; the regulatory points name their source.

 * REVIEW: this text is written for the hackathon and must be reviewed by a person who owns
 * compliance content before it is relied on. `last_reviewed` stays null until that review
 * happens. Tax: India's Income-tax Act, 2025 replaces the 1961 Act from April 2026, so the
