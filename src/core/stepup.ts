 * registered phone and refuses STEP_UP_REQUIRED; with the code it hands over to
 * LedgerService.confirm, which spends the token and charges the card.
 *
 * The code never appears in a tool result, so the model cannot approve a payment by itself: only
 * someone holding the phone can. The text names the amount and the recipient, so the code is
 * bound to that one payment. Codes are stored as salted hashes, are never logged, last 5 minutes
 * (never past the token), and 3 wrong tries void the confirmation.
